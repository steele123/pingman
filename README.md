# pingman
Pingman is a very fast pinger with an extremely verbose cli interface with very many options we support pinging an absurd amount of proxies or a bunch of websites.

Pingman uses the tokio runtime for its amazing tasks to run all the requests in parallel, so they have no delay between each of them.
